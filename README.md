# Pitched

Have you ever wanted to speed up/down videos or audio but have them pitched up/down?
This isn't possible today as browsers add a pitch preserving algorithm if the video's speed isn't 1.

Pitched allows you to disable this algorithm.

It's available for Firefox [here](https://github.com/Nerixyz/pitched/releases). 
It's not tested for Chrome, but it should work there too.
